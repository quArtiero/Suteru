# 🌍 Šutēru – Knowledge That Transforms 📚🍽️  

## What is Šutēru?  
Šutēru is a **social impact initiative** designed to bridge the gap between **education and hunger relief**. It is a platform where **learning leads to real-world impact**—every correct answer in an educational quiz results in a donation that helps fight food insecurity.  

### 🌟 Our Vision  
We believe that **knowledge should drive action**. In a world where education and food insecurity remain pressing issues, Šutēru connects **students, companies, and NGOs** to create a system where **learning directly benefits communities in need**.  

### 🎯 How It Works  
- **Users engage with quizzes** in subjects like math, science, and history.  
- **Each correct answer translates into a food donation**, funded by corporate partners.  
- **NGOs distribute the donations** to those in need, ensuring transparency and measurable impact.  

### 🚀 Why It Matters  
Millions of people face **daily food insecurity**, while access to quality education remains **unequal**. Šutēru creates a **win-win solution** where learners **gain knowledge** while making a **real difference in the world**.  

### 🔜 Project Status  
Šutēru is currently **in development**. We are working on building the platform, forming partnerships, and refining our impact model. Stay tuned for updates as we get closer to launching!
